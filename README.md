### 🧠 About Me

I'm a data-driven engineer with a passion for building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. I'm currently pursuing my **Master’s in High Integrity Systems** at Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences and diving deep into **Natural Language Processing**, **Deep Learning**, and **Large Language Models**.

With industry experience in companies like **Accenture**, **Cognizant**, and **Deutsche Börse**, I’ve worked on projects ranging from chatbot development and trade analytics to data engineering pipelines. I'm currently enhancing my skills in **LLM fine-tuning**, model interpretability, and real-world ML deployment.
